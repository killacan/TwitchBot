# TwitchBot!

### Intro

Hello and welcome to llamachop_bot (named after a hat I wear on stream). This is my first project involving Machine Learning and Neural Networks. 

Basically what this project does is connect with Twitch channels and provide some extra interactivity in a way I have not yet seen before. 

### Tech

- TMI (library for a Websocket configured specifically for Twitch.)
- Brain.js (a GPU accelerated library for Neural Networks written in JavaScript.)
- Natural (general natural language facility for nodejs.)


### Next Steps

I think the next steps for this project are going to make it more modular, allow for more user input, make a frontend and get it hosted somewhere.
